# Python Todo App
Created using Python 3.8. I picked tkinter for making the GUI, and it worked out quite well. I was able to build this in a couple hours with 0 knowledge of tkinter beforehand.

# Usage

1. Fork (if you want to make changes) or clone the repo into a directory of your choosing.

2. Run `pipenv install` to setup the virtual env

3. Run `pipenv run main.py` OR `python -u main.py` to launch the app!
